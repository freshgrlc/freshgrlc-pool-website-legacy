                    <p>
                        One of the complaints I still get from time to time is that the reported hashrate one
                        this website is lower than it should be. Some miners therefore decide to go to other
                        pools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ever since the new rolling-average hashrate estimation has been implemented, I feel
                        that the hashrate calculations should be pretty precise (once they have fully stabilized
                        after a few hours) and I have therefore also removed the warning/disclaimer we used
                        to have on the site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said, it is still true that the hashrate estimations are only used within the website's
                        UI. Payout is 100% based on shares sent to the pool. The main issue here however, is that if
                        the reported hashrate is lower than expected, it is probably being caused by the fact that
                        less shares are being send to the pool than otherwise would be the case, hence the pool's
                        hashrate estimation (based on those shares), as well as miner reward payout, is lower than
                        expected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, it is of course easy to say that the pool is somehow showing incorrect information or maybe
                        even ignoring some shares send by the miner, therefore reducing both the estimated hashrate
                        as well as payouts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To counter these claims, and in an attempt at full transparency, we do now have a special page
                        that can be used to test and verify the pool's processing of your submitted shares. That way,
                        you can verify that the pool is correctly processing all the shares you sent in and therefore
                        rewarding you correctly based on the work you are actually doing (i.e. if you are randomly hashing,
                        but for example generating a lot of hardware errors, therefore not doing a lot of actual work,
                        there is no reason for the pool to reward you for the work you did not do).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hopefully, this page will clear things up and lead to one of the following conclusions with
                        relation to why you are maybe paid less than you thought you would:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your miner is fine, but the pool had a period of bad luck (this is now verifiable using the new luck graphs).</li>
                            <li>Your miner is fine, but it itself had a peiod of bad luck (hence it was sending in less shares than expected).</li>
                            <li>There is an actual issue with your mining setup and you might be able to tweak it by changing (for example) intensity settings.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The page is available through the 'My worker' tab. You can run the test without having to stop
                        mining at the pool, as it just analyses pool worker data. You do however need access to your mining
                        software (i.e. you - typically - can't do this remotely), as you will need to verify the pool's share
                        counter using the share counter within your miner software.

                    <p>
                        The pool has been restarted to apply a small fix to the pool's luck data gathering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might have noticed that some datapoints are missing in the luck graphs. This was
                        caused by the data gatherer sometimes missing the end of the capture window, therefore
                        combining multiple measurement windows into a single datapoint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that this does not make the luck graphs incorrect, just somewhat imprecise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This issue has now been fixed and new data should no longer have this flaw.

                        The original website was only made with 20 - 30 workers in mind and a hardcoded limit of 100 workers.<br />
                        When Garlicoin mainnet launched and both the network as a whole as well as this pool got a lot more traction
                        than expected, a lot of changes had to be made in a short time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the final changes, and overhaul of this website, is now complete: Have a look around!

                        Apart from the overal design (and the same shitty style ;-) , the main features are pool luck graphs
                        and an easier way to view worker statistics.

                    <div class="smallheading">Note on share management</div>
                    Everyone's shares will decrease by 90% if the pool finds a block<br />
                    (except when multiple blocks are found within a small amount of time).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shares decrease by 5% whenever anyone finds a new block on the network<br />
                    (this happens more or less every 41 seconds).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Workers under the minimum share floor of 8 shares don't get paid,<br />
                    but are also not affected by the 5% share decrease<br />
                    (this to decrease the amount of dust the pool is generating somewhat).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is all part of the payout management logic in order to keep payout fair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that this does not mean that the pool takes a fee by decreasing worker shares,<br />
                    as shares are the only thing on which block reward payout is based. Rather,<br />
                    this is a way to get workers that stopped mining slowly out of the system<br />
                    while still giving them something for their work.<br />
                    It also helps new workers joining to pool to get a little bit extra in times<br />
                    where the pool is unlucky and can't find a block for a while.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These numbers might change in the future.
