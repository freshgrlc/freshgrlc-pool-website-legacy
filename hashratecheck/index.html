                <h1 class="yellow">FreshGRLC worker hashrate verification page</h1>
                <p>
                    This page was created because I still occasionally receive complaints about the hashrate on the pool's website being wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This page allows you to manually verify whether the hashrate calculated by the pool corresponds to the amount of
                    shares your worker is sending in. If this is indeed that case, then for whatever reason (including the possibility
                    that you are just being unlucky), your miner is sending less shares to the pool than expected for its hashrate,
                    hence the pool estimates a lower hashrate than it should.
                </p>
                <p class="yellow" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 600;">
                    If this is the case, then it is not a problem with the pool, but rather with your mining setup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are advised to run the test until the reported hashrate more or less stabilizes, or at least for a minute or 10 (600 seconds).
                    The test works best if you have only one worker connected to the pool under a specific address. That way you can verify the
                    pool share counter against the shares reported by your mining software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If for whatever reason you see the pool processing <em><i>less</i></em> shares than you sent in
                    (with the exception of a very small difference, see the note below), please contact
                    <em>nuc1e4r5n4k3#5815</em> on Discord about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="smallheading">Note</span><br />
                    Using this page to verify your hashrate will not interrupt the mining at this pool, even if it requires you
                    to reconnect to a different stratum port.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="smallheading">Note</span><br />
                    Due to the way this page connects to the pool, it can happen that it occasionally misses a single share.
                    The chance for this to happen is however very low and it should not be more than max 1%.<br />
                    This only affects this page and not the pool in general.
